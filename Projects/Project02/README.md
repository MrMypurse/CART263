COIN N TOYS is an interactive website created to mocking Youtubers/influencers
on the Internet today who spam contents targeting children to generate revenue.
The goal of the website is to "brainwash" children and pre-teens enough that
they will buy everything that's on their screen. To use the website, the user
must repeat after the words on the screen to generate "coins". When the user
has enough "coins", he/she can purchase toys on the webpage. This type of
repetitive action should influence a child's unconsciousness and their decisions
when they see purchasable items online.

My inspiration came from James Bridle's essay, "Something is wrong on the
internet", and my experience as a YouTube addict in general. Although Bridle's
essay focuses more on the violent/inappropriate contents online. I want to
emphasize that children, pre-teens and young teenagers have trouble
differentiating actual contents and advertisements, which make them vulnerable
online. Although most children related contents are considered family-friendly
online, there is 0  regulation about advertising to children on most media
platforms. Unlike television programs, the internet lets companies advertise
as much as they want to children.

I started the project by using a simple template on W3 schools and changed
certain elements to fit my vision, because I want the website to look organized
and clean. I also want the website to be visual- heavy, and have brighter colors
that will catch children's attention. I first thought about making a child
friendly game as a “safe space” on the Internet, then I realized that a mocking
website would be more fun (for me). During the process, I had some trouble
with the hover effect, because it is something new to me. I also had difficulty
dealing with modal images, including how to exactly “open” the specific gif
images when the user makes a “purchase”. I first used a jQuery modal library,
but it did not work well with my concept. After a few different approaches,
I finally found the perfect way to convert the png images to gif images.

Overall, I learned many things about voice commands and jQuery during the
process. If I can improve the game, I want to add an “inventory” system, where
the user can review the toys that they already bought. Maybe the inventory
system can be a small image editor so the user can play with the image. Or the
inventory system can direct the user to an actual toy related game.
